# Hospital Management System

 ## Introduction

### Purpose:

This software will help to be more efficient in registration of their patients and manage appointments, records of patients. It enables doctors and admin to view and modify appointments schedules if required. The purpose of this project is to computerize all details regarding patient details and hospital details. 

### Scope:

The system will be used as the application that serves hospitals, clinic, dispensaries or
other health institutions. 
The intention of the system is to increase the number of patients that can be treated and managed properly.
If the hospital management system is file based, management of the hospital has to put much effort on securing the files. 
They can be easily damaged by fire, insects and natural disasters. Also could be misplaced by losing data and information.

### Problem Statement:

Current hospital management systems often suffer from inefficiencies and a lack of user-friendly interfaces, hindering smooth operations and timely patient care. To address these shortcomings, there is a critical need for a streamlined system that prioritizes user experience, real-time data access, and efficient task management to improve overall hospital performance and patient satisfaction.


## System Overview
The application has two modules: an admin module for managing user accounts, tracking transactions, and updating doctor information, and a user module for doctors to confirm/cancel appointments, prescribe medications, and for patients to book appointments, make payments, and track transaction history.


### Function Requirements:
1. patient management
2. staff management
3. inventory management
4. financial management
5. reporting and analytics 
6. communication and collaboration.
7. Our system should be active 24 by 7
8. Our system should be strong for managing data

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: Ensuring patient data confidentiality and protection.
- Performance: Efficiently handling large volumes of patient data and transactions.
- Scalability: Ability to accommodate growth in users and data.
- Reliability: Dependability and availability of the system.
- Usability: Intuitive interface for healthcare professionals.

Our user interface should be interactive, simple and easy to understand . The system should prompt the user and administrator to login to the application for proper input criteria.



## Technology Stack:

### App:
For our project, we are utilizing Eclipse and NetBeans as the integrated development
environments (IDEs) for coding. Eclipse offers a robust and customizable environment that enhances productivity with its powerful tools, while NetBeans provides a user-friendly interface and excellent support for Java development.


### Language: 

 Java is our primary programming language in this project. Eclipse and NetBeans both IDEs allow us to efficiently manage the codebase and streamline the development process. 

 
### Design:

For the design of icons and graphical assets, we are leveraging Canva, a versatile and intuitive online design tool. Canva enables us to create visually appealing and professional-quality icons and graphics without the need for advanced design skills, ensuring that our project maintains a polished and cohesive look.


# Conclusion:

This Hospital Management System project aims to streamline the management of patient information, scheduling, and emergency alerts using Java programming. The system will facilitate real-time updates on patient data, provide alerts for critical situations, and support hospital staff in delivering efficient and secure healthcare services.
